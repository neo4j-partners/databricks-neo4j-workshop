# Part A: Genie space for Aircraft Sensor Analytics

In this part, you'll create a Databricks AI/BI Genie space that enables natural language queries over your aircraft sensor telemetry data. This Genie will become one of the sub-agents in your multi-agent system.


---

## Step 1: Explore the Lakehouse Data

Your workshop admin has pre-loaded a set of tables into Unity Catalog that represent the Aircraft Digital Twin sensor telemetry. This is the data you will use to create your Genie space — a natural language interface that lets agents query sensor readings, compare fleet metrics, and detect anomalies using SQL under the hood.

1. Click **Catalog** in the left sidebar.
2. Expand **databricks-neo4j-workshop > lakehouse**.
3. Browse the available tables:

| Table | Rows | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `aircraft` | 20 | Fleet inventory — tail numbers, models, manufacturers, operators |
| `systems` | 80 | Aircraft systems — engines, avionics, hydraulics |
| `sensors` | 160 | Sensor metadata — EGT, vibration, N1 speed, fuel flow |
| `sensor_readings` | 345,600 | Hourly telemetry readings over 90 days (July–September 2024) |

4. Click on any table (e.g., `sensor_readings`) and select the **Sample Data** tab to preview its contents.

These four tables form a join chain — `sensor_readings` → `sensors` → `systems` → `aircraft` — that connects raw telemetry values all the way up to fleet-level metadata. The Genie space you create in the next steps will use this structure to answer natural language questions by generating SQL queries across these tables automatically.

## Step 2: Create the Genie space

### 2.1 Navigate to AI/BI Genie

1. In your Databricks workspace, click **New** > **Genie space**
2. Or navigate to **AI/BI** in the left sidebar and click **New Genie space**

### 2.2 Connect Your Data

After clicking **New Genie space**, the **Connect your data** dialog appears. Select All Catalogs ->  `databricks-neo4j-workshop`  -> `aircraft` -> then select `sensor_readings`, `aircraft`, `sensors`, `systems`.

> **Tip:** These tables form a join chain: `sensor_readings` -> `sensors` -> `systems` -> `aircraft`


![Connect your data dialog](images/genie_connect_data.png)

> **Tip:** If you don't see the table under **Recent**, click **All** or use the search bar to find `databricks-neo4j-workshop`.

### 2.3 Configure Basic Settings

Once the Genie space is created, click **Configure** in the top navigation bar, then select the **Settings** tab:

![Genie space Configure > Settings panel](images/configure_basics_genie.png)

1. **Title:** `Aircraft Sensor Analyst [YOUR_INITIALS]`
   - Example: `Aircraft Sensor Analyst RK`
2. **Description:** "Analyzes aircraft engine sensor telemetry including EGT, vibration, N1 speed, and fuel flow metrics"
3. **Default warehouse:** Select a **Serverless SQL Warehouse**

### 2.4 Add Sample Questions

Still on the **Settings** tab, scroll down to **Sample questions**. These train the Genie to understand domain-specific language. Click **+ Add** and enter these examples:

**Time-Series Analytics**

```
What is the average EGT temperature for aircraft N95040A over the last 30 days?
```

**Fleet Comparisons**

```
Compare average EGT temperatures between Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft
```

**Anomaly Detection**

```
Find sensors with readings above their 95th percentile value
```

**Trend Analysis**

```
Show the trend of EGT temperatures over the 90-day period for aircraft N95040A
```

## Step 4: Add Instructions

Navigate to **Configure** > **Instructions**. Instructions provide domain knowledge and query conventions. These instructions give the Genie domain knowledge about sensor types, normal ranges, and data conventions so it can generate accurate SQL queries. Enter the following:

```
# Aircraft Sensor Analytics Domain Knowledge

## Sensor Types and Normal Ranges
- EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature): Normal range 640-700 degrees Celsius, measured in C
- Vibration: Normal range 0.05-0.50 inches per second, measured in ips
- N1Speed (Fan Speed N1): Normal range 4,300-5,200 RPM, measured in rpm
- FuelFlow: Normal range 0.85-1.95 kg/s, measured in kg/s

## Fleet Information
- 20 aircraft in the fleet
- 4 operators: ExampleAir, SkyWays, RegionalCo, NorthernJet
- Models: B737-800 (Boeing), A320-200 (Airbus), A321neo (Airbus), E190 (Embraer)

## Sensor Configuration
- Each aircraft has 2 engines
- Each engine has 4 sensors: EGT, Vibration, N1Speed, FuelFlow
- Total: 160 sensors across the fleet (20 aircraft x 2 engines x 4 sensors)

## Data Conventions
- Timestamps are stored as timestamp type in the `timestamp` column
- Data period: July 1, 2024 to September 29, 2024 (90 days)
- Readings are hourly (24 per day per sensor)
- 2,160 readings per sensor over the 90-day period

## Sensor ID Format
- Format: AC{aircraft_number}-S{system_number}-SN{sensor_number}
- Example: AC1001-S01-SN01 = Aircraft 1001, Engine 1 (S01), EGT sensor (SN01)
- S01 and S02 are always engines; S03 is Avionics; S04 is Hydraulics
- SN01=EGT, SN02=Vibration, SN03=N1Speed, SN04=FuelFlow

## Engine Names by Model
- B737-800: CFM56-7B engines
- A320-200: V2500-A1 engines
- A321neo: PW1100G engines
- E190: CF34-10E engines

## Query Conventions
- When asked about "Engine 1", filter by systems where name contains "#1"
- When asked about "Engine 2", filter by systems where name contains "#2"
- Use tail_number for human-readable aircraft references (e.g., N95040A)
- Use aircraft_id for internal references (e.g., AC1001)
- Always include units in results (C, ips, rpm, kg/s)
```

## Step 5: Test the Genie

### 5.1 Start a Conversation

Click **Start conversation** or go to the chat interface.

### 5.2 Test Basic Queries

Try these progressively complex queries:

**Query 1: Simple Aggregation**
```
What is the average EGT temperature across all sensors?
```
Expected: A single number around 650-680 degrees Celsius

**Query 2: Filtering by Aircraft**
```
Show the average EGT for aircraft N95040A
```
Expected: Average EGT for that specific aircraft

**Query 3: Time-Series Trend**
```
Show daily average EGT for aircraft AC1001 in July 2024
```
Expected: ~30 rows with date and average value

**Query 4: Cross-Table Join**
```
Compare average vibration readings by aircraft model
```
Expected: Results grouped by B737-800, A320-200, A321neo, E190

**Query 5: Statistical Analysis**
```
Find the top 5 sensors with the highest average readings for their type
```
Expected: Top sensors with their average values and types

### 5.3 View the SQL Generation

For each query, click **View Code** to see the generated query is correct:

Example for "Compare average vibration by aircraft model":
```sql
SELECT
    a.model,
    AVG(r.value) as avg_vibration,
    COUNT(*) as reading_count
FROM sensor_readings r
JOIN sensors sen ON r.sensor_id = sen.sensor_id
JOIN systems s ON sen.system_id = s.system_id
JOIN aircraft a ON s.aircraft_id = a.aircraft_id
WHERE sen.type = 'Vibration'
GROUP BY a.model
ORDER BY avg_vibration DESC
```

## Step 6: Save and Note the Genie space ID

### 6.1 Save Configuration

Click **Save** to preserve your Genie space configuration.

### 6.2 Record the Genie space Name

Note the exact name of your Genie space (e.g., `Aircraft Sensor Analyst RK`). You'll need this in Part B when configuring the multi-agent supervisor.

## Summary

You've created a Genie space that can:

- Query 345,600+ sensor readings using natural language
- Aggregate by aircraft, model, operator, or sensor type
- Perform statistical analysis (averages, percentiles, standard deviation)
- Join across the data model to provide context-rich answers
- Understand domain-specific terminology (EGT, N1Speed, etc.)
