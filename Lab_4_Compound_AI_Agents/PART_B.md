# Part B: Multi-Agent Supervisor for Aircraft Intelligence

In this part, you'll create a multi-agent supervisor that intelligently routes questions to either the **Genie space** (for sensor analytics) or the **Neo4j MCP agent** (for graph relationships). This enables natural language queries that span both data sources.

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Completed **Part A** (Genie space for sensor analytics)
- Access to the Unity Catalog schema `databricks-neo4j-workshop.aircraft` (tables and volume)

> **Note on the Neo4j MCP connection:** This lab uses a **pre-configured Neo4j MCP connection** that has already been set up by the workshop administrators. The MCP server points to the **Reference Aura Instance**, an administrator-managed Neo4j Aura instance, not your individual Aura instance from Lab 1. It contains the **complete dataset**: the full fleet with all systems, components, sensors, maintenance events, flights, and delays. This ensures every participant has access to the full graph regardless of which Lab 2 notebooks they completed.

---

## Step 1: Verify Neo4j MCP Connection

The Neo4j MCP connection has been **pre-configured** by the workshop administrators. In this step you'll verify that it's available and working in your workspace.

### 1.1 Check Unity Catalog Connections

1. In the left navigation pane, click **Catalog**
2. Click **External connections** (or navigate to the **Connections** tab)
3. Locate the Neo4j MCP connection named `neo4j_agentcore_mcp`
4. Verify the connection status shows as configured

> **Note:** This MCP connection points to the Reference Aura Instance, which contains the full Aircraft Digital Twin dataset. You do not need to configure this yourself — it has been set up ahead of time so that all participants share the same complete graph data.

### 1.2 Verify MCP Tools Are Available

The Neo4j MCP server provides these tools:
- `get-schema`: Retrieves the Neo4j graph schema (labels, relationships, properties)
- `read-cypher`: Executes read-only Cypher queries

You can test these in AI Playground before creating the supervisor:
1. Navigate to **Playground** in the left navigation
2. Select **GPT OSS 120B**
3. Click **Add your own tool** > **+ Add tool** > **MCP Servers** > **External MCP Servers** > **neo4j_agentcore_mcp**
4. Ask:

```
What is the schema of the database?
Which aircraft had critical maintenance events?
```

---

## Step 2: Create the Multi-Agent Supervisor

### 2.1 Navigate to Agent Bricks

1. In the left navigation pane, click **Agents**
2. Find the **Multi-Agent Supervisor** tile
3. Click **Build**

### 2.2 Configure Basic Settings

1. **Name:** `Aircraft Intelligence Hub [YOUR_INITIALS]`
   - Example: `Aircraft Intelligence Hub RK`
2. **Description:**
   ```
   Intelligent coordinator for aircraft analytics combining sensor telemetry
   data from Unity Catalog with knowledge graph relationships from Neo4j.
   ```

---

## Step 3: Add the Neo4j Graph Agent

## Step 5: Create the Agent

Click **Create Agent** to deploy the supervisor.

> **Note:** Deployment may take several minutes to complete. The status will update when ready.

---

## Step 6: Configure Supervisor Instructions

### 6.1 Set Supervisor Instructions

1. Scroll to the bottom of the agent configuration page
2. Expand the **Optional** section
3. In the **Instructions** field, enter the following:

```
# Aircraft Intelligence Hub - Routing Instructions

You are an intelligent coordinator for aircraft analytics. Your role is to understand user questions and route them to the appropriate specialized agent.

## Available Agents

### sensor_data_agent (Genie space - Unity Catalog SQL)
Use for questions about:
- Sensor readings and telemetry data
- Time-series analytics (averages, trends, rolling windows)
- Statistical analysis (percentiles, standard deviation)
- Fleet-wide comparisons of sensor metrics
- Anomaly detection based on readings
- Questions containing: EGT, vibration, N1, fuel flow, temperature, readings, averages, trends

### mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp (Neo4j Knowledge Graph - Cypher)
Use for questions about:
- Aircraft structure and topology
- Component relationships and hierarchy
- Maintenance events and fault history
- Flight operations, routes, delays
- "Which", "what systems", "connected to", "related to" questions
- Questions about maintenance, flights, delays, airports

## Routing Rules

1. **Sensor values/readings** -> sensor_data_agent
   - "What is the EGT for..."
   - "Show vibration readings..."
   - "Average fuel flow..."

2. **Relationships/structure** -> mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp
   - "What systems does aircraft X have?"
   - "Which components..."
   - "Show maintenance events..."

3. **Flights/operations** -> mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp
   - "Which flights were delayed?"
   - "What airports does..."
   - "Show flight routes..."

4. **Maintenance history** -> mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp
   - "What maintenance events..."
   - "Which components had faults?"
   - "Critical maintenance..."

5. **Statistical aggregations on readings** -> sensor_data_agent
   - "Average", "maximum", "minimum", "percentile"
   - "Trend", "over time", "daily", "monthly"
   - "Compare", "between", "by model"

## Complex Queries (Multi-Agent)

For questions that need BOTH sources, process sequentially:

1. **"Find aircraft with high vibration AND recent maintenance"**
   - First: sensor_data_agent -> Get aircraft with high vibration
   - Then: mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp -> Get maintenance events for those aircraft

2. **"Which engines have abnormal EGT and what components were serviced?"**
   - First: sensor_data_agent -> Find abnormal EGT readings
   - Then: mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp -> Find maintenance events for those engines

3. **"Compare sensor trends for aircraft that had delays"**
   - First: mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp -> Get aircraft with delays
   - Then: sensor_data_agent -> Get sensor trends for those aircraft

## Response Guidelines

1. For single-agent queries: Return the agent's response directly
2. For multi-agent queries: Synthesize a combined response that integrates both perspectives
3. Always cite which data source provided each piece of information
4. If a query cannot be answered by either agent, explain what data would be needed
```

### 6.2 Save Changes

Click **Update Agent** to save the instructions.

---

## Step 7: Test the Multi-Agent System

### 7.1 Start Testing

Once deployment completes:
1. Use the **Test your Agent** panel on the right side of the Build tab
2. Or click **Open in Playground** for expanded testing with AI Judge features

### 7.2 Test Single-Agent Routing

**Test 1: Sensor Analytics (should route to sensor_data_agent)**
```
What is the average EGT temperature across the fleet?
```
Verify: The query is routed to sensor_data_agent and returns a numerical average

**Test 2: Graph Relationships (should route to mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp)**
```
What systems does aircraft AC1001 have?
```
Verify: The query is routed to mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp and returns engine, avionics, hydraulics systems

**Test 3: Maintenance Events (should route to mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp)**
```
Show me all critical maintenance events in the last month
```
Verify: Returns maintenance events with severity=CRITICAL

**Test 4: Fleet Comparison (should route to sensor_data_agent)**
```
Compare average vibration readings between Boeing and Airbus aircraft
```
Verify: Returns grouped statistics by manufacturer

### 7.3 Test Multi-Agent Queries

**Test 5: Combined Query**
```
Find aircraft with EGT readings above 680 degrees and show their maintenance history
```
Expected behavior:
1. Supervisor routes to sensor_data_agent for high EGT aircraft
2. Supervisor routes to mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp for maintenance history
3. Response synthesizes both data sources

**Test 6: Another Combined Query**
```
Which engines had above-average vibration, and what components were recently serviced on those engines?
```
Expected behavior:
1. Get high-vibration engines from sensor_data_agent
2. Get maintenance events from mcp-neo4j-agentcore-mcp
3. Combine and present results

---

## Step 8: Improve Through Feedback

### 8.1 Add Example Questions

1. Navigate to the **Examples** tab
2. Click **+ Add** to introduce test questions
3. Enter questions that represent common user queries

### 8.2 Share with Subject Matter Experts

1. Share the configuration page link with domain experts
2. Grant experts `CAN_MANAGE` permission on the supervisor
3. Ensure experts have appropriate access to each subagent

### 8.3 Add Guidelines

1. Select each example question
2. Add **Guidelines** labels that refine routing behavior
3. Test again to validate improvements
4. Click **Update Agent** to save changes

---

## Step 9: Optional - Query the Endpoint Programmatically

1. Click **See Agent status** or **Open in Playground**
2. Select **Get code** to retrieve API examples
3. Choose between **Curl API** or **Python API**

Example Python usage:
```python
import requests

# Get your endpoint URL from the agent status page
ENDPOINT_URL = "https://<workspace>.databricks.com/serving-endpoints/<agent-name>/invocations"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {DATABRICKS_TOKEN}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(
    ENDPOINT_URL,
    headers=headers,
    json={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What systems does AC1001 have?"}]}
)
print(response.json())
```

---

## Summary

You've created a multi-agent system that combines two purpose-built data platforms:

- **Genie + Lakehouse for time-series data** — SQL-powered analytics over sensor telemetry readings, ideal for aggregations, trends, and statistical analysis
- **Neo4j for rich relational data** — graph-powered traversals across aircraft topology, maintenance events, flights, and delays, ideal for relationship queries and multi-hop navigation
- **Intelligent routing** — the supervisor directs each question to the right data source automatically
- **Cross-source synthesis** — complex questions that span both systems are answered by querying each sequentially and combining the results
- **Natural language access** — users ask questions without needing SQL or Cypher knowledge

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent not responding"
- Check MCP connection status in **Catalog** > **Connections**
- Verify Neo4j instance is running
- Test Genie space independently in AI Playground
- Ensure user has `USE CONNECTION` permission on the MCP connection

### "Wrong agent selected"
- Review and enhance agent descriptions with more specific keywords
- Add explicit routing patterns in supervisor instructions
- Use the Examples tab to add labeled training questions

### "Cypher query failed"
- Check that Neo4j data was loaded correctly (Lab 2)
- Verify node labels and relationship types match documentation
- Review Cypher syntax for errors
- Test queries directly in Neo4j Aura console first

### "SQL query failed"
- Verify table names in Unity Catalog: `databricks-neo4j-workshop.aircraft`
- Check column names match documentation
- Ensure Genie space has access to all required tables
- Test queries directly in SQL Editor first

### "Permission denied"
- For Genie space: User needs access to the space AND underlying data tables
- For MCP server: User needs `USE CONNECTION` permission on the Unity Catalog connection
- For supervisor: User needs `CAN QUERY` permission on the agent endpoint
