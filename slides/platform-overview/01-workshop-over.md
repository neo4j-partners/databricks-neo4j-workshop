# Neo4j and Databricks Workshop

Build AI Agents and Knowledge Graphs with Neo4j and Databricks

---

## What You'll Build

- **Load** aircraft fleet data into a Neo4j knowledge graph using the Spark Connector
- **Explore** a pre-deployed agent that queries Neo4j via MCP
- **Build** a multi-agent supervisor combining Databricks Genie (sensor analytics) with Neo4j MCP (graph queries)
- **Add** semantic search with vector embeddings and GraphRAG retrievers
- **Create** a no-code Aura Agent with Cypher Templates, Text2Cypher, and Similarity Search

## What Is a Digital Twin?

A **digital twin** is a virtual representation of a physical system — its structure, state, and behavior modeled in data.

For an aircraft fleet this means capturing:
- **Topology**: Aircraft, systems, components, and sensors and how they connect
- **Operations**: Flights, routes, delays
- **Maintenance**: Events, faults, component removals, corrective actions
- **Documentation**: Maintenance manuals, procedures, operating limits

---

## Why Knowledge Graphs for Digital Twins?

Digital twins are fundamentally about **relationships** — a component belongs to a system, a system belongs to an aircraft, a fault affects a component, a removal follows a maintenance event.

**Knowledge graphs model this naturally:**
- Entities become **nodes** with properties
- Connections become **relationships** with types and properties
- Multi-hop traversals are native — no expensive JOINs
- The graph *is* the twin — query it, reason over it, extend it

Tabular databases can store the same data, but answering "Which components caused flight delays?" requires chaining multiple JOINs across many tables. In a graph, it's a single traversal.

## The Aircraft Digital Twin Dataset

The workshop uses a comprehensive dataset modeling a complete aviation fleet over 90 operational days:

| Entity | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Aircraft | 20 | Tail numbers, models, operators |
| Systems | 80 | Engines, Avionics, Hydraulics per aircraft |
| Components | 320 | Turbines, Compressors, Pumps |
| Sensors | 160 | Monitoring metadata |
| Sensor Readings | 345,600+ | Hourly telemetry over 90 days |
| Flights | 800 | Departure/arrival information |
| Maintenance Events | 300 | Fault severity and corrective actions |
| Airports | 12 | Route network |

---

## Dual Database Architecture

The data is split across two platforms, each chosen for the workload it handles best:

**Databricks Lakehouse** — Time-series sensor telemetry
- 345,600+ hourly readings across 90 days
- Columnar storage and SQL for aggregations, trend analysis, statistical comparisons

**Neo4j Aura** — Richly connected relational data
- Aircraft topology, component hierarchies, maintenance events, flights, delays, airport routes
- Native multi-hop traversals without expensive JOINs

A multi-agent supervisor routes questions to the right database automatically.

## Workshop Infrastructure: Shared Resources

Shared resources are pre-configured by administrators so participants can focus on the labs:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Reference Aura Instance** | Fully populated Neo4j database with the complete Aircraft Digital Twin — all node types, relationships, embeddings |
| **Neo4j MCP Server** | External MCP server connected to the Reference Aura Instance |
| **Sample MCP Agent** | Pre-deployed agent that calls Neo4j MCP for natural language graph queries |
| **Databricks Data & Tables** | CSV files in Unity Catalog Volume and pre-created Lakehouse tables |
| **Databricks MCP Connection** | External MCP server registered in Unity Catalog |

---

## Workshop Infrastructure: Personal Resources

Each participant gets their own environment to work in:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Personal Aura Instance** | Your own Neo4j database to load data into during ETL labs and explore independently |
| **Databricks Workspace** | Clone notebooks and run them on a shared cluster to build your graph and agents |

Labs using the **MCP server** (Supervisor Agent) connect to the **shared** Reference Aura Instance — so every participant works with the full graph regardless of their personal instance's state.

Labs doing **ETL and GraphRAG** (Labs 2, 3) load data into your **personal** instance.
